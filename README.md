# Netflix Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing Netflix data to uncover insights about movies and TV shows on the platform. The data was cleaned and processed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, and an interactive dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize key trends.

## Project Structure
- `netflix_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis using Python.
- `Netflix_Analysis.pbix`: Power BI dashboard file with visualizations built on the cleaned data.
- `data/` : Folder containing raw and cleaned data files (e.g., CSVs).
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI Desktop

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`netflix_analysis.ipynb`) to view and run the data cleaning and analysis code.
2. Load the cleaned dataset into Power BI by opening `Netflix_Analysis.pbix` to explore the dashboard.
3. Modify or extend the analysis as needed.

## Future Work
- Automate data cleaning inside Power BI using Python scripts.
- Add more visualizations and interactivity.
- Integrate with live Netflix data API for real-time analysis.
